# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A simple web application that generates and displays lottery numbers. The application features a clean interface with a button to generate new numbers and a display area for the results.

## Implemented Features

*   **Lotto Number Generation:** Generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Number Display:** Displays the generated numbers in colored circles.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout is centered and should adapt to different screen sizes.
*   **Dark Mode (Default):**
    *   The application now defaults to dark mode.
    *   Added a dark mode toggle switch to the `index.html` file.
    *   Defined dark mode color variables and styles in `style.css`.
    *   Implemented the logic in `main.js` to toggle the dark mode class on the body and save the user's preference in `localStorage`.
    *   Added a console log for debugging the theme switch.
